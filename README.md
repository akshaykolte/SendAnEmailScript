# SendAnEmailScript
On-the-go email sending script written for a friend, using some old code from a personal project.

Download project and run python ***send_email.py***.
Enter required info on terminal.

You may need to ***turn on Access for less secure apps on Gmail*** (You will recieve a mail the first time you run the script. Follow instructions in the mail).

Script works for gmail only (can be easily changed).
